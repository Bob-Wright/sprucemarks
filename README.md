<h1>I wanted a bookmarks sort and used this previously. Now I see mods can be shared. I removed Mobile and Other support, I use this with xbrowsersync.
Second thing is the original writer has some really nice code!</h1>

Sprucemarks is a Google Chrome Extension that automatically sorts your bookmarks.

Available normally in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sprucemarks/fakeocdnmmmnokabaiflppclocckihoj) and now open source too.

## Developing

Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and enable `Developer Mode`.

Use `Load unpacked extension...` to point to the deploy folder inside Sprucemarks.

## Deploying

Everything in the `deploy` directory should be zipped and then uploaded via the Chrome Web Store's [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).
